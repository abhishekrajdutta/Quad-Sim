The original package is the result of a Senior Design project at Drexel University. The team consisted of:
D. Hartman, K. Landis, M. Mehrer, S. Moreno, and J. Kim.
Their faculty advisor was Dr. B. C. Chang

I have modified it with a formulation of a Non-linear Integrator Backstepping controller. Also, an IMU model using a gyroscope(L3GD20) and an accelerometer(LSM303DLHC) has been added.
globals.m in the 
/media/abhishek/Storage/Matlab/Quad-Sim/Quadcopter Dynamic Modeling and Simulation/Simulation Files/Simulink Models
directory has to be run to use the new models.
